# Statistical-Data-Visualization-with-seaborn
##A coursera guided project from UTS which contains preprocessing and data visualization using the python sebaorn library.
The operations are performed on a dataset which contains the diagnosis reports of a cancer hospital whose target variable is the diagnosis which says if a tumour is malignant('M') or benign('B'). I have then used the XBGoost classifier for classification and have performed univariate feature selection and recursive feature elimination using cross-validation. The details have been mentioned in the python notebook.
